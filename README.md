# Learning Java with Team Treehouse @ https://teamtreehouse.com

The sub folders are simply collections of java programs that run independently from the others. Each is designed to tackle different introductory concepts within Java.

Example concepts:
- object oriented programming
- classes and methods
- interfaces
- mapping
- regular expressions

My favorite of the programs is within the hangman sub folder. When compiled, launch is with a starting argument (java Hangman <String>). That word will become the word choosen for a game of hangman. Hand off the program to a friend and watch them solve the word within the command line!
More advanced topics are soon to come!
